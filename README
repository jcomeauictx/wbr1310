o This file contains steps for building toolchain and building the image.

Step 1. Install fedora linux 12 (choose Software Development) on 32bit CPU.

Step 2. Building the toolchain

  1) Please login as a normal user such as john, and copy the gpl file to normal user folder,
     such as the folder /home/john

  2) $cd /home/john

  3) $tar zxvf WBR1310_GPL.tar.gz

  4) $cd wbr1310

  5) $./build_tool_chain.sh

	  Please choose the "Target Ptocessor Architecture" as "Generic (MIPS I) (CONFIG_MIPS_ISA_1)",
	  and keep other settings as the default value.

		*
		* Target Architecture Features and Options

		choice[1-6?]: 1
		Target Processor Endianness
		  1. Little Endian (ARCH_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
		> 2. Big Endian (ARCH_BIG_ENDIAN)
		choice[1-2?]: 2
		Target CPU has a memory management unit (MMU) (ARCH_HAS_MMU) [Y/n/?] (NEW)
		Enable floating point number support (UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS) [Y/n/?] y
	  	  Target CPU has a floating point unit (FPU) (HAS_FPU) [Y/n/?] (NEW)

		*
		* General Library Settings
		*
		Generate Position Independent Code (PIC) (DOPIC) [Y/n/?] y
		Enable support for shared libraries (HAVE_SHARED) [Y/n/?] y
		Compile native shared library loader (BUILD_UCLIBC_LDSO) [Y/n/?] (NEW)
		  Only load shared libraries which can share their text segment (FORCE_SHAREABLE_TEXT_SEGMENTS) [N/y/?] n
		  Native shared library loader 'ldd' support (LDSO_LDD_SUPPORT) [Y/n/?] y
		  Enable shared library loader cache (LDSO_CACHE_SUPPORT) [Y/n/?] y
		  Enable shared library loader preload file support (LDSO_PRELOAD_FILE_SUPPORT) [N/y/?] n
			Shared library loader naming prefix (LDSO_BASE_FILENAME) [ld.so] ld.so
		  Enable ELF RUNPATH tag support (LDSO_RUNPATH) [N/y/?] n
		uClibc 0.9.27 compatibility (DL_FINI_CRT_COMPAT) [N/y/?] (NEW)

  6) If you see the following messages,

	  c-parse.y:1664.19-20: $$ for the midrule at $4 of `structsp_attr' has no declared type
	  c-parse.y:1674.19-20: $$ for the midrule at $4 of `structsp_attr' has no declared type
	  c-parse.y:1682.19-20: $$ for the midrule at $4 of `structsp_attr' has no declared type
	  c-parse.y:1687.19-20: $$ for the midrule at $3 of `structsp_attr' has no declared type
	  make[2]: *** [/home/john/wbr1310/buildroot/toolchain_build_mips/gcc-3.3.5/gcc/c-parse.c] Error 1
	  make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/john/wbr1310/buildroot/toolchain_build_mips/gcc-3.3.5-initial/gcc'

	  make: Leaving directory `/home/john/wbr1310/buildroot'

	 then goto 7), else goto 10)

  7) $vi buildroot/toolchain_build_mips/gcc-3.3.5/gcc/c-parse.y 

	  a) Press "i" to enter edit mode

	  b) Modify variable $$ to $<ttype>$ at line : 1664, 1674, 1682, 1687

	  c) Press "Esc" to exit edit mode, then save and exit(:wq)

  8) $make -C buildroot

  9) $./build_tool_chain.sh

  10) After build toolchain successfully, you will get the prompt line,
	  "Use source ./setupenv to setup your environment variables !"


Step 3. You can use the toolchain to build image now.

  1) $source ./setupenv

  2) $make

  3) $cp kernel/wrgg19.config kernel/.config

  4) $cd kernel
  
  5) $make menuconfig
	
	  a) Choose <Exit> at the bottom of the menu
	
	  b) Do you wish to save your new kernel configuration?
		 Choose <Yes>		  
  
  6) $make

  7) $make

  8) $cd .. (pwd is /home/john/wbr1310)

  9) $make

  10) After make successfully, you will find the image file in ./images/.

	  Upgrade the new firmware by web interface provide by device, 
	  then you will get your specific image.
